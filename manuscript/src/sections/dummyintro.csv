% Water Scarcity and the Case of Morocco
Water scarcity is one of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century. Globally, over two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and projections suggest that by 2050 more than half of the world’s population may face severe water shortages (ref). The drivers of this crisis are multidimensional: rapid population growth, urbanization, agricultural intensification, and climate change combine to increase water demand while diminishing reliable supply. Climate change in particular exacerbates hydrological variability, altering rainfall patterns, intensifying droughts, and reducing the predictability of freshwater availability (ref). As a result, water scarcity has emerged not only as an environmental challenge but also as a source of economic vulnerability and geopolitical tension.
    
In North Africa, Morocco provides a vivid case study of these dynamics. The country is characterized by an arid to semi-arid climate, with highly uneven spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall. Periodic droughts have long constrained agricultural production, the backbone of the Moroccan economy, and limited the reliability of water supply for cities and industries. Since the mid-twentieth century, Morocco has pursued a “dam-building state strategy” as its principal water security policy. Beginning with only 13 large dams in 1956, the country expanded its portfolio to over 100 by 1999, with the goal of ensuring irrigation water, drinking water, hydropower, and flood control (Loudyi et al., 2018). Today, Morocco manages one of the largest dam networks in Africa, and this infrastructure continues to be regarded as a cornerstone of its national water policy.

Despite this achievement, Morocco’s water security is under growing strain. Several structural challenges undermine the effectiveness of its dam-based approach. Rising temperatures and declining precipitation have led to more frequent and severe droughts, reducing inflows into reservoirs. Projections for North Africa consistently forecast declining water availability under most climate scenarios (ref). Morocco’s population has nearly tripled since independence, and water-intensive sectors such as irrigated agriculture and urban industry have expanded rapidly. This has created intense demand pressure on limited supplies. Traditional irrigation techniques, such as surface flooding, remain widespread, leading to substantial water losses compared to modern drip or sprinkler systems (Belokda et al., 2018). Sediment accumulation in reservoirs is one of the most pressing concerns. Studies show that many Moroccan dams are losing capacity at alarming rates, reducing their lifespan and limiting their ability to regulate water across dry years (Loudyi et al., 2018; Belokda et al., 2018).

In recent years, Morocco has diversified its water strategy. Large-scale investments have been directed toward desalination plants, particularly for supplying coastal cities; groundwater exploitation, though increasingly unsustainable due to aquifer depletion; and emerging energy-water nexus technologies, such as pumped hydro storage integrated with renewable energy systems (Hamad & Tanabe, 2022; Elmansour et al., 2022). Nevertheless, dams remain the central pillar of Morocco’s water infrastructure and continue to receive the largest share of investment.

The contemporary policy challenge is therefore not simply to build more dams but to optimize investments in existing infrastructure. With over 100 dams in operation and dozens more under consideration, decision-makers must determine which sites are most suitable for expansion and rehabilitation in order to maximize returns under fiscal and environmental constraints. The stakes are high: investments must balance economic efficiency (e.g., cost-effectiveness and energy generation), environmental sustainability (e.g., ecosystem impacts, sediment management), and social equity (e.g., regional water distribution, access to rural communities).

Conventional cost–benefit analysis is insufficient for such a complex task because it cannot adequately capture multiple, often conflicting, criteria. Moreover, the uncertainty of climate change complicates long-term projections, requiring flexible and adaptive decision-support systems. These realities point toward the need for more sophisticated analytical tools. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) models offer precisely such an approach, enabling the integration of diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria into a coherent framework for prioritizing dam investments.

\subsection{Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)}
Decision-making in real-world contexts rarely involves a single objective. Governments, businesses, and communities often face situations where they must evaluate multiple conflicting goals—such as maximizing economic returns while minimizing environmental damage, or ensuring efficiency while promoting social equity. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) emerged as a scientific approach precisely to handle such problems, offering a structured way to evaluate alternatives when trade-offs are unavoidable (Taherdoost & Madanchian, 2023).

At its core, MCDM refers to a set of quantitative and qualitative techniques designed to support decisions that involve multiple, often conflicting, evaluation criteria. Unlike simple optimization models, which focus on maximizing or minimizing a single objective, MCDM allows decision-makers to systematically weigh different objectives. In this way, it mirrors a process of collective intelligence: just as a group of individuals contributes diverse perspectives to reach a collective judgment, MCDM integrates diverse evaluation criteria to generate a balanced decision outcome.

The roots of MCDM lie in the broader field of operations research and decision theory, which gained prominence during World War II as mathematical methods were applied to optimize logistics, resource allocation, and planning (Ajis et al., 2013). Early decision-making models focused on single-objective optimization, but as decision contexts became more complex, researchers in the 1960s and 1970s began developing tools that could account for multiple objectives simultaneously. Goal Programming, introduced by Charnes and Cooper in the 1960s, was one of the pioneering approaches (Tamiz, Jones, & Romero, 1998). By the 1980s and 1990s, a wide family of MCDM methods—including Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ELECTRE, and TOPSIS—had been developed and widely applied (Kumar et al., 2017).

Over time, MCDM has evolved into an interdisciplinary field, integrating ideas from mathematics, economics, computer science, and social sciences. The increasing availability of computational power has further advanced the field, enabling the development of fuzzy MCDM methods to handle uncertainty (Liang, 1999; Mardani et al., 2015) and hybrid methods that combine MCDM with artificial intelligence and machine learning (ref). Today, MCDM is recognized as a cornerstone of modern decision science.

Applications and Relevance

MCDM techniques are applied across a wide range of domains. In engineering and environmental planning, they are used to evaluate infrastructure projects, assess environmental impacts, and optimize resource allocation (Harputlugil et al., 2011). In energy planning, they guide investments in renewable energy technologies and grid optimization (Kumar et al., 2017). In management and finance, they support portfolio selection, risk assessment, and policy analysis (Ajis et al., 2013). Increasingly, MCDM is also applied in sustainability contexts, where decision-making requires balancing economic, environmental, and social objectives (Taherdoost & Madanchian, 2023).

These applications reflect the nature of problems MCDM is designed to solve: situations with multiple stakeholders, conflicting objectives, incomplete information, and long-term uncertainties. In this respect, MCDM resonates strongly with the philosophy of collective intelligence. Both fields address the challenge of integrating diverse inputs into a coherent solution. Where collective intelligence emphasizes the aggregation of human perspectives and knowledge, MCDM emphasizes the aggregation of quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria. The parallels are striking: just as collective intelligence prevents domination by a single voice in group decision-making, MCDM prevents domination by a single criterion in technical decision-making.

Relevance in Today’s World

The importance of MCDM has grown in recent decades due to the increasing complexity of global challenges. Climate change, resource scarcity, and sustainable development goals all require decisions that balance competing priorities. For instance, governments must decide how to allocate limited water supplies across agriculture, energy, and domestic use; companies must balance profitability against environmental and social responsibility; and communities must weigh development needs against cultural and ecological preservation. Traditional single-objective decision tools fall short in these contexts, while MCDM offers a structured and transparent process for evaluating trade-offs.

In summary, MCDM provides a rigorous yet flexible decision-support framework, particularly well-suited to wicked problems—those with no single optimal solution but multiple competing pathways. This makes it a powerful tool for addressing Morocco’s dam site investment challenge, where economic, social, and environmental goals must all be considered simultaneously under conditions of uncertainty.

\subsection{MCDM in Water Resource Management and Dam Site Selection}
The complexity of water resource management makes it an ideal domain for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM). Water decisions inherently involve trade-offs: between supply and demand, economic growth and environmental protection, or short-term needs and long-term sustainability. MCDM methods have therefore been widely adopted to structure decision-making in contexts such as irrigation planning, watershed management, groundwater allocation, and hydropower development (Moiz et al., 2018; Abdullah et al., 2022). By integrating economic, social, technical, and environmental factors, MCDM allows decision-makers to evaluate alternatives holistically rather than relying on narrow single-objective optimization.


In water allocation problems, MCDM models help balance agricultural, domestic, and industrial demands under conditions of scarcity. For example, fuzzy MCDM approaches have been used to address uncertainty in water availability and user priorities (Mardani et al., 2015). Similarly, Geographic Information System (GIS)–based MCDM frameworks have been applied to groundwater exploration and watershed conservation, enabling spatial integration of hydrological, geological, and socio-economic factors (Serpoush et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2023). These approaches are increasingly vital as climate change introduces new uncertainties into hydrological systems.

Among water-related infrastructure, dam site selection has been a major focus of MCDM applications. Dams play multiple roles—water supply, irrigation, energy generation, flood control—each with its own evaluation criteria. Traditional feasibility studies, based primarily on technical and economic factors, often neglected environmental and social dimensions. MCDM methods address this gap by enabling the integration of multi-dimensional criteria into site selection frameworks (Roudgarmi et al., 2019). 

Researchers have employed a wide range of MCDM techniques for dam and hydropower site selection.Many studies combine spatial datasets with MCDM models to assess dam suitability across large areas. For instance, Karakuş and Yıldız (2022) applied GIS-based multi-criteria analysis to assess land suitability for dam construction, while Yi et al. (2010) used GIS and MCDM for small hydropower location analysis. AHP has been extensively applied to weigh criteria in dam and hydropower site selection, often in combination with GIS tools (Abdullah et al., 2022; Rana & Patel, 2020). Machine learning has been integrated with MCDM to improve site ranking accuracy. For example, Shimray et al. (2017) trained a neural network with genetic algorithms for hydropower site ranking. Recent studies emphasize environmental and social considerations, such as ecosystem protection, resettlement impacts, and water-energy-ecosystem trade-offs (Temel et al., 2023; Jafari et al., 2021).


The literature reveals several trends in the application of MCDM to dam site selection.Increasing integration of GIS for spatially explicit analysis, Growing emphasis on sustainability and ecosystem impacts alongside economic and engineering criteria, use of fuzzy and probabilistic methods to address uncertainty in hydrological and climate data. exploration of hybrid models that combine MCDM with optimization algorithms or AI techniques. These approaches demonstrate the versatility of MCDM in handling the complex, multi-criteria nature of dam planning.

Despite progress, significant challenges remain. First, the selection of criteria and their relative weights is often subjective, varying across stakeholders and decision contexts (Roudgarmi et al., 2019). Second, data scarcity—especially in developing regions—limits the precision of many models (Moiz et al., 2018). Third, most studies focus on greenfield site selection for new dams or small hydropower projects, while fewer address the optimization of existing dam infrastructure. Finally, there is limited application of MCDM frameworks to North African contexts, despite the acute water scarcity and reliance on dams in countries such as Morocco (Loudyi et al., 2018; Belokda et al., 2018).

This gap is particularly important because Morocco’s challenge is not merely identifying new dam sites but prioritizing among existing sites for expansion and rehabilitation under fiscal, environmental, and climate constraints. Addressing this problem requires a systematic MCDM framework that balances economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and social equity.


\subsection{Collective Intelligence in MCDM}
Collective Intelligence (CI) refers to the phenomenon where groups of individuals, when organized effectively, can make better decisions or solve problems more efficiently than any individual acting alone. It builds on the aggregation of diverse perspectives, experiences, and knowledge to arrive at higher-quality solutions (Borges et al., 2020). In many respects, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) mirrors this process: just as CI integrates multiple human viewpoints, MCDM integrates multiple evaluation criteria—economic, environmental, technical, and social, into a coherent decision framework.

Both CI and MCDM seek to handle complex, multidimensional problems where trade-offs must be managed. They share key features: the integration of diversity, structured decision processes, and the pursuit of solutions that balance competing objectives (Kacprzak, 2020; Cinalli et al., 2015). Yet, they differ in focus: CI is human-centered, emphasizing participatory deliberation, negotiation, and legitimacy, while MCDM is model-centered, emphasizing analytical rigor and systematic evaluation.

Among the wide family of MCDM methods, Goal Programming (GP) stands out as the most flexible framework for incorporating collective intelligence of decision makers. Unlike ranking-based methods such as AHP or outranking models like ELECTRE, GP explicitly allows decision-makers to formulate and prioritize multiple goals simultaneously, reflecting the diversity of perspectives that CI emphasizes (Tamiz, Jones, & Romero, 1998).

Weighted Goal Programming (WGP) captures the relative importance of different goals, reflecting the weighted preferences of groups or stakeholders.

Lexicographic Goal Programming (LGP) allows goals to be arranged in a strict hierarchy, mirroring the way groups sometimes establish non-negotiable priorities before considering secondary ones.

Chebyshev Goal Programming (CGP) minimizes the maximum deviation across goals, embodying a fairness principle akin to CI, where the aim is to avoid dominance by any one criterion.

Extended Goal Programming (EGP) incorporates more complex trade-offs, enabling nuanced preference modeling.

Most notably, Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) offers a powerful extension that directly reflects collective intelligence processes. In real-world decision-making, groups rarely agree on a single numeric target; instead, they negotiate acceptable ranges or intervals for objectives. MCGP accommodates this by allowing goals to be expressed not as fixed points but as ranges (Jones & Tamiz, 2010). This flexibility reduces conflict, increases realism, and better aligns with the participatory nature of CI.

 In CI, groups adapt their decisions as new information or perspectives emerge. Sensitivity analysis in MCDM mirrors this process: it tests how outcomes shift under different weightings, priorities, or constraints, providing insight into the robustness of solutions. This adaptability is critical in contexts like Morocco’s water planning, where uncertainty about climate, demand, and sedimentation can significantly affect dam site priorities. By combining GP with sensitivity analysis, decision-making becomes not just optimized but also resilient and adaptive.

Future Prospects

Bridging CI and MCDM offers significant opportunities for addressing complex infrastructure challenges. Incorporating stakeholder input into goal setting and weighting ensures that technical models remain socially legitimate. Conversely, applying GP models within participatory CI frameworks provides rigor and transparency to group deliberations. Together, these approaches hold promise for hybrid systems that integrate human judgment with mathematical optimization—an approach particularly suited to Morocco’s dam site investment challenge.

\subsection{Models Selection}
Over the past decades, a wide range of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) models have been developed to address the challenge of evaluating alternatives under multiple, often conflicting objectives. These models differ in how they structure problems, aggregate criteria, and generate solutions, but all share the goal of supporting more transparent and rational decision-making.

Overview of Major MCDM Models

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP): Introduced by Saaty in the 1970s, AHP decomposes a decision problem into a hierarchy of goals, criteria, and alternatives. Decision-makers make pairwise comparisons, and the method derives numerical weights that represent relative importance (Abdullah et al., 2022). Its main advantage is simplicity and ease of stakeholder involvement, though it is often criticized for subjectivity and inconsistency (Ajis et al., 2013).

Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS): Developed in the 1980s, TOPSIS evaluates alternatives based on their distance from an “ideal solution” and an “anti-ideal solution.” It is popular for ranking alternatives but may oversimplify complex trade-offs (Kacprzak, 2020).

Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) and Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE): These outranking methods compare alternatives pairwise across criteria, establishing dominance relations. They are particularly suited for cases with qualitative data or where stakeholders seek to rule out dominated options (ref).

Fuzzy MCDM: Extends traditional models by incorporating fuzzy sets to capture uncertainty and vagueness in human judgments (Liang, 1999; Mardani et al., 2015). Useful in water and energy planning where data may be imprecise.

While these models have been widely applied, they often face limitations in balancing multiple objectives simultaneously under strict resource or policy constraints. For this reason, Goal Programming (GP) and its variants have become particularly influential in resource allocation and infrastructure planning.

Goal Programming (GP): Foundations

Goal Programming is a mathematical optimization technique developed as an extension of linear programming to handle multiple, potentially conflicting goals (Tamiz, Jones, & Romero, 1998). Rather than seeking a single objective optimum, GP minimizes the deviations between actual outcomes and predefined goals. This makes it especially suitable for problems like dam site investment, where multiple performance goals—economic, social, environmental—must all be addressed concurrently.

Key features of GP that make it well-suited to collective, multi-stakeholder decisions include:

Flexibility in handling diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria.

Accommodation of priorities, whether by assigning weights or setting hierarchical structures.

Transparency, as decision-makers can explicitly see trade-offs between goals.

Variants of Goal Programming

Several variants of GP have been developed to address different decision contexts:

Weighted Goal Programming (WGP): Assigns weights to goals, reflecting their relative importance. Useful when stakeholders agree on the importance of criteria but still want to balance them.

Lexicographic Goal Programming (LGP): Ranks goals in strict priority order. It reflects real-world cases where some objectives are non-negotiable (e.g., meeting minimum water supply before considering cost efficiency).

Chebyshev Goal Programming (CGP): Minimizes the maximum deviation among goals. This ensures fairness, preventing one criterion from being disproportionately neglected, a property that resonates with collective intelligence values.

Extended Goal Programming (EGP): Provides flexibility in modeling nonlinearities and more complex relationships between goals.

Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP): Extends GP by allowing goals to be expressed as ranges rather than fixed points (Jones & Tamiz, 2010). This is particularly relevant to participatory decision-making, as stakeholders often specify “acceptable intervals” instead of rigid targets. In dam site investment, this allows for realistic modeling of water demand, economic return, and environmental thresholds.

Sensitivity Analysis in MCDM    

A critical component of applying GP in practice is sensitivity analysis. In MCDM, sensitivity analysis examines how changes in weights, priorities, or constraints affect the final decision. This is vital in contexts such as Morocco’s dam selection problem, where uncertainty in climate projections, budget constraints, and population growth can shift priorities over time. Sensitivity analysis thus enhances the robustness and adaptability of decisions, ensuring that recommendations remain valid even as conditions evolve.

Justification for Goal Programming in Dam Site Selection

Compared with other MCDM models, Goal Programming offers the most flexible and transparent framework for integrating diverse criteria and stakeholder perspectives into a single decision system. Its ability to incorporate collective intelligence, through weighted preferences, lexicographic priorities, fairness mechanisms, and multi-choice ranges—makes it particularly appropriate for water infrastructure decisions that must balance competing objectives under uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis further strengthens this approach, ensuring that policy recommendations are both technically rigorous and resilient to future change.


\subsection{Criteria Selection}
The robustness of any Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model depends fundamentally on the choice of evaluation criteria, since these define the dimensions along which dam sites are assessed. The inclusion or exclusion of particular indicators can significantly influence outcomes, as previous studies on dam planning have demonstrated (Roudgarmi et al., 2019). In this study, ten criteria were selected to evaluate and prioritize dam sites for investment in Morocco, combining technical, environmental, socio-economic, and infrastructural dimensions to ensure a balanced assessment. Table 1 summarizes these criteria, their units, data sources, and justifications.

Technical indicators such as dam height, storage capacity, and reservoir area were included because they determine the physical potential of a site to store water and generate hydropower. These measures are widely used in hydropower site selection literature and remain fundamental in investment decisions (Moiz et al., 2018; Rana & Patel, 2020). Climatic conditions, represented by temperature and rainfall, provide essential insight into the sustainability of storage and inflows. High temperatures intensify evaporation losses, while rainfall history indicates hydrological reliability, both of which are critical under Morocco’s variable climate (Belokda et al., 2018).

Socio-economic dimensions were captured by commune population, proximity to residential centers, farmland area, and farmland distance. Population reflects demand pressure and potential beneficiaries, though normalization was necessary to prevent large communes from skewing results (Ersoy, 2022; Kosareva, 2018). Likewise, farmland measures account for the agricultural benefits of dam expansion, emphasizing the role of irrigation in Morocco’s water strategy (Ghumman et al., 2020). Proximity to settlements ensures accessibility and equity, aligning with social sustainability goals.

Finally, infrastructural connectivity, represented by the distance to the nearest road, was included because access routes directly affect construction costs, operational efficiency, and maintenance feasibility (Yi et al., 2010). Together, these ten dimensions ensure that the analysis captures Morocco’s triple objective: meeting water demand, ensuring economic returns, and promoting long-term sustainability.

To estimate the targets for each criterion, the model maximizes values under the constraint of selecting three dams with a total budget of 500 million USD. The maximum achievable objective then serves as the benchmark or “target.” This approach ensures that the targets are not arbitrary but instead reflect realistic upper bounds within fiscal and operational constraints.

Insights from prior studies further underscore the importance of such criteria design. For instance, Rana and Patel (2020) demonstrated that including population data shifted site rankings compared to purely technical models, while Temel et al. (2023) showed that incorporating ecological considerations produced different priorities than cost-based evaluations alone. These findings confirm that criteria selection fundamentally shapes decision outcomes.

The ten selected criteria provide a comprehensive and context-appropriate framework for evaluating Morocco’s dams. By incorporating physical, climatic, social, and infrastructural factors (see Table 1), the study ensures methodological rigor while reflecting principles of collective intelligence. The subsequent inclusion of sensitivity analysis further enhances robustness, ensuring that results remain adaptable under future uncertainty.

% The Kingdom aims to achieve a storage capacity of 30 billion cubic meters of rainwater in the coming years and to increase the number of dams to 170 by 2030. There is about 149 existing reserv  oirs. Dams are classified into small, medium, and large with capacities of 

\subsection{Data Sources}
Dam height data was obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN)\cite{FAO_AQUASTAT_MAR}. Dam height is in meters (m). Dam height is measured as...
Dam capacity is also otained from the FAO. It is the volume of the reservoir in million (1000000) cubic meters. It referes to the initial capacity of the dam, not taking into consideration the reduction in volumne due to sedimentation. Likewise, the reservoir surface area is obtained from the FAO dam profile for Morocco. It is measures in square kilometers. 

Temperature and rainfall historical data are obtained from NASA rainfall API \cite{NASA_POWER_API}. The monthly data spanned from 2010 to 2024. Monthly data for each dam site commune is summed up and the median rainfall value taken for each dam site. Thus, rainfall is measured in millimeters per year. A similar approach is taken for temperature, which is measured in degrees celcius.

Commune population, nearest road, farmland area, farmland distance are extracted from unique shapefiles. The shapefiles are obtained from sig-maroc website \cite{SIG_Maroc_Shapefiles} and processed with both QGIS and python to extract the relevant data. Commune population informs how many people reside in the same commune as the dam site, nearest road measures  the shortest distance between the dam site and closest road, farmland area estimates farm size by it's surface area, and farmland distance measures the distance from the dam site to the closest farmland, whose  area is taken.   

The original commune population data extracted varied greatly (range: 1493137.00, minimum:1276.00, maximum:1494413.00), which could affect the outcome of the models\cite{Ersoy2022}. Thus, the population data is normalized between 0 and 50 using the min-max normalization\cite{Kosareva2018}\cite{population_normalization_py}. Nearest road is creteria is estimated using the geographical coordinates of each dam \cite{Coordinates2025}and and a region provintial routes shapefile\cite{routes2025}. The python geopanda package is used to calculate path between dam site and closest provintial road in meters (m) and converted into kilometers (km)\cite{roadsCode2025}. A similar approach is used to extract farmland distance using a land use land cover (LULC) shapefile\cite{LULC_MegaArchive}. Farmland area is also estimated in meter squared $m_2$ using same LULC shapefile and python libraries\cite{farmlandAreaCode2025}. Nearest conglomerate residence is the distance between the dam site and the nearest most populated habitation. Nearest most populated habitation is spotted using visual observation on Google Maps \cite{congolerateResidenceGearth2025}. The shortest distance (km) between the two points is estimated using the python geopy package \cite{congloResidence2025}.
