\caption{EGP contributions by criterion: comparison of the $D$-normalized terms (used in the minimax bound) versus the terms entering the $(1-\alpha)$ weighted-sum portion of the objective ($\alpha=0.8$). The $D$-binding criterion is \emph{Temperature}; the weighted-sum is dominated by \emph{Residence}.}
