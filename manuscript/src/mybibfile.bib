abstract = {This paper presents a novel fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) based on the concepts of ideal and anti-ideal points. The concepts of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis are used to develop a weighted suitability decision matrix to evaluate the weighted suitability of different alternatives versus various criteria. The distance of different alternatives versus positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution are then obtained by using the proposed ranking method. Finally, the relative approximation values of various alternatives versus positive ideal solution are ranked to determine the best alternative.}

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this research is to introduce a novel ensemble approach using Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), frequency ratio (FR), and random forest (RF) models for groundwater-potential mapping (GWPM) in Bastam watershed, Iran. This region suffers from freshwater shortages and the identification of new groundwater sites is a critical need. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) were used to reduce time and financial costs of rapid assessment of groundwater resources. Seventeen physiographical, hydrological, and geological groundwater conditioning factors (GWCFs) were derived from a spatial geo-database. Groundwater data were gathered in field surveys and well-yield data were acquired from the Iranian Department of Water Resources Management for 89 locations with high yield potential values ≥ 11 m3 h−1. These data were mapped in a GIS. From these locations, 62 (70%) were randomly selected to be used for model training, and the remaining 27 (30%) were used for validation of the model. The relative weights of the GWCFs were determined with an RF model. For GWPM, 220 randomly selected points in the study area and their final weights were determined with the VIKOR model. A groundwater potential map was created by interpolating the values at these points using Kriging in GIS. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was plotted for the groundwater potential map. The success rate curve (SRC) was computed for the training dataset, and the prediction rate curve (PRC) was calculated for the validation dataset. Results of RF analysis show that land use and land cover, lithology, and elevation are the most significant determinants of groundwater occurrence. The validation results show that the ensemble model had excellent prediction performance (PRC = 0.934) and goodness-of-fit (SRC = 0.925) and reasonably high classification accuracy. The results of this study could aid management of groundwater resources and assist planners and decision makers in groundwater-investment planning to achieve sustainability.},

We propose a min-max goal programming formulation to derive the AHP priorities in the case that the decision maker provides preference judgements in the form of interval numbers. By applying variable transformations, we formulate a linear programming model that is capable of estimating the priorities from both consistent and inconsistent interval judgements. The proposed method is illustrated by numerical examples.}}

abstract = {This paper presents two methods of decision making, Weighted multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) and MINMAX MCGP. With the proposed Weighted MCGP method, decision makers can set different weights wi for each goal with linguistic terms, such as high, average and low, which can be transformed into trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Meanwhile, with the proposed MINMAX MCGP method, this study also let decision makers set the satisfaction membership function for each goal according to their preference in order to eliminate the effect of different scales in each goal. This paper also investigates the relationship between Weighted multi-choice goal programming and MINMAX multi-choice goal programming. According to the sensitivity analysis, decision makers can get the solution with the minimum aggregate deviation for all multiple goals from the Weighted multi-choice goal programming. Meanwhile, decision makers can get the solution with the most balanced solution between all multiple goals from the MINMAX multi-choice goal programming method. The weight variable is introduced to the above two methods to provide decision-makers with a mechanism to evaluate the discrepancy between the maximum aggregate achievement and the most balanced solution, enabling decision-makers to reach the preferable decision for their situation. A real-world problem of supplier selection by the purchasing and sales managers of a manufacturing company is used to illustrate the differing solutions given by the two models.}

While they are the most common, other newer versions can offer theoretical and practical advantages.

ABSTRACT = {The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations are at the center of the global political agenda to eradicate extreme poverty, achieve universal education, promote gender equality and ensure environmental sustainability between others. These goals are organised in 169 indicators, which give an accurate perspective on the main dimensions related with country sustainable development. To gain insight into the relative position of involved countries, it is necessary to develop a composite index that summarises the global progress in the achievement of these goals, but considering possible conflicts and trade-offs between individual SDGs. The objective of this paper is to introduce a Goal Programming model to calculate a composite SDG index, capable of overcoming some of the limitations of celebrated approaches such as arithmetic and geometric averages. The proposed model balances between two extreme solutions: one which calculates a consensus index that reflects the majority trend of the SDGs, and another one which biases the estimated index towards those SDGs that show the most discrepancy with the rest. The model is applied on the EU-28 countries, and shows that the best performing countries regarding the sustainable development are Austria and Luxembourg, while Greece and Romania remain as the worst performers.},

In the decision process, extended GP (EGP) approach, i.e. convex combination of both the modelling aspects, minsum GP and minmax GP are addressed in the achievement function for minimizing the possible regret towards goal achievement from the optimistic point of view in the inexact decision making environment.

Its importance lies in its ability to gain additional insight into potential changes that affect the desirability of the decision variants being evaluated. Through different methodologies, it reveals the vulnerability of results to changes in the underlying data, thus offering valuable information to support decision making. This research paper highlights a compendium of 250 researches involving the application of sensitivity analysis in a multi-criteria context. Using a structured approach of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, this study provides a comprehensive review process. The main objectives are to identify and categorize common sensitivity analysis techniques explained in the literature and to describe a selected framework that facilitates the execution of these techniques. The research demonstrates the importance of sensitivity analysis to enhance the credibility of MCDA outcomes and contributes to the field of decision support}

Although there remains an abundant of potential sites for SHP plants in Korea, SHP development has scarcely been performed since the 1990s due to the absence of a suitable approach and economic feasibility. Such a situation encourages decision makers to develop a systematic approach for SHP development. The purpose of this study is to propose a new location analysis methodology to search for potential SHP sites using GSIS (Geo-Spatial Information System). The location analysis in this study focuses on establishing the criteria and methodology for searching for alternative locations rather than selecting the most suitable site among the alternatives. By applying the newly developed methodology, a large area can be precisely surveyed within a short period of time and we expect to be able to use the method in policy making for SHP development by improving the convenience for the user. The newly developed methodology was applied to the upper part of Geum River Basin, in Korea, and found six potential SHP sites. As a fundamental work, this study will be beneficial to the future activation of SHP development.}}

The current regional energy policies are developed primarily based on technical and socio-economical aspects and lack ecological considerations that may deteriorate the ecosystems and sustainability of these policies. Hence, considering the water-energy-ecosystem nexus in the development stage of the energy policies can aid decision-makers in initiating successful multi-dimensional energy policies. This study proposes a novel approach to develop an environmental index to support the regional energy policies that rely on Run-of-river (RoR) hydroelectric power plants (HEPPs) with a nexus approach. First, significant environmental impacts of RoR HEPPs are identified as environmental flows, impacts on ecologically valuable areas such as heritage sites, wetlands, national parks, river water quality degradation, modification of habitat, and impact on ecosystems and biodiversity loss. Then these impacts are represented through indicators and are aggregated into an overall environmental performance index through a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach. The proposed approach allows the integration of ecological dimensions into the evaluation of RoR HEPPs through easy-to-measure indicators, among which environmental flow is a critical component.}

abstract = {In the current era of sustainable development, energy planning has become complex due to the involvement of multiple benchmarks like technical, social, economic and environmental. This in turn puts major constraints for decision makers to optimize energy alternatives independently and discretely especially in case of rural communities. In addition, topographical limitations concerning renewable energy systems which are mostly distributed in nature, the energy planning becomes more complicated. In such cases, decision analysis plays a vital role for designing such systems by considering various criteria and objectives even at disintegrated levels of electrification. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is a branch of operational research dealing with finding optimal results in complex scenarios including various indicators, conflicting objectives and criteria. This tool is becoming popular in the field of energy planning due to the flexibility it provides to the decision makers to take decisions while considering all the criteria and objectives simultaneously. This article develops an insight into various MCDM techniques, progress made by considering renewable energy applications over MCDM methods and future prospects in this area. An extensive review in the sphere of sustainable energy has been performed by utilizing MCDM technique.}

abstract = {Decision-making in environmental projects requires consideration of trade-offs between socio-political, environmental, and economic impacts and is often complicated by various stakeholder views. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) emerged as a formal methodology to face available technical information and stakeholder values to support decisions in many fields and can be especially valuable in environmental decision making. This study reviews environmental applications of MCDA. Over 300 papers published between 2000 and 2009 reporting MCDA applications in the environmental field were identified through a series of queries in the Web of Science database. The papers were classified by their environmental application area, decision or intervention type. In addition, the papers were also classified by the MCDA methods used in the analysis (analytic hierarchy process, multi-attribute utility theory, and outranking). The results suggest that there is a significant growth in environmental applications of MCDA over the last decade across all environmental application areas. Multiple MCDA tools have been successfully used for environmental applications. Even though the use of the specific methods and tools varies in different application areas and geographic regions, our review of a few papers where several methods were used in parallel with the same problem indicates that recommended course of action does not vary significantly with the method applied.}

These sectors depend on the same grey infrastructure, such as dammed reservoirs, which has created negative socio-ecological externalities and sectoral conflicts in the past. Yet, future needs for infrastructure in both sectors and their interdependencies remain unclear. We address this gap by applying data-fusion and machine-learning approaches and provide a comprehensive global overview and a new dataset that elucidates the role of existing dams and reservoirs for hydropower and irrigation. We then review projected demands for irrigation storage and hydropower by 2050 and analyze how projected growth aligns with the identified potential for irrigation and hydropower dams. Globally, projections point to an increased demand for hydropower in the order of 400 GW by 2050, which amounts to around 60 %–64 % of the identified potential and around +35 % compared to today. For irrigation, fully leveraging sustainable water resources would require 460 km3/yr of stored water, or around +70 % compared to today. Projected demands for hydropower and irrigation are larger than what future grey infrastructure could provide in many regions, especially in Europe, South Asia, and Africa. In such conditions, both sectors will be increasingly in competition for infrastructure. Our findings also highlight the need to study alternative solutions, such as other forms of renewable energy and nature-based solutions for water storage, to meet societal demands while avoiding negative externalities associated with grey water infrastructure.}

ABSTRACT = {Dams can effectively regulate the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, where the rationality of dam siting determines whether the role of dams can be effectively performed. This paper reviews the research literature on dam siting in the past 20 years, discusses the methods used for dam siting, focuses on the factors influencing dam siting, and assesses the impact of different dam functions on siting factors. The results show the following: (1) Existing siting methods can be categorized into three types—namely, GIS/RS-based siting, MCDM- and MCDM-GIS-based siting, and machine learning-based siting. GIS/RS emphasizes the ability to capture and analyze data, MCDM has the advantage of weighing the importance of the relationship between multiple factors, and machine learning methods have a strong ability to learn and process complex data. (2) Site selection factors vary greatly, depending on the function of the dam. For dams with irrigation and water supply as the main purpose, the site selection is more focused on the evaluation of water quality. For dams with power generation as the main purpose, the hydrological factors characterizing the power generation potential are the most important. For dams with flood control as the main purpose, the topography and geological conditions are more important. (3) The integration of different siting methods and the siting of new functional dams in the existing research is not sufficient. Future research should focus on the integration of different methods and disciplines, in order to explore the siting of new types of dams.},

A suitability map was developed by integrating multiple data sets, such as digital elevation models (DEMs), lithology, drainage density, and lineament density. By utilizing a weighted overlay analysis, the study area was categorized into segments with varying suitability levels for hill dam installation (ranging from unsuitable to very high potential). Covering an area of 39 km², the results indicated that 8% of the total area possessed very high potential. The findings were validated through field surveys that were conducted both prior to and following the study; these confirmed the high-potential areas that were identified by the model, thereby enhancing the reliability of the suitability map for future hill dam planning and flood-risk-mitigation strategies.}, number={2}, journal={Geomatics and Environmental Engineering}, author={Zerdeb, Oumaima and Labriki, Allal and Manaouch, Mohamed and Chakiri, Said and Sadiki, Mohamed}, year={2025}, pages={49–69}}

ABSTRACT = {In this paper we propose a goal programming model that provides a consensual aggregated solution minimizing conflicts to guide multi-stakeholder decision-making processes and generates information regarding stakeholder groups to be exploited for negotiation purposes. This model permits to quantify variations in conflicts when the relative contribution of each criteria changes and gives insight to negotiation strategies with application in conservation areas. A dataset of a case study in the Meseta Ibérica Biosphere Reserve (Portugal-Spain) was used to test and validate the model. Fifty people belonging to four groups (scientists, government, farmers and businesspersons) assessed 20 management objectives in four dimensions: conservation, logistical support, development, and governance. The results showed the highest conflicts to be found for fauna and flora, education, and guarantees objectives while the most conflictive groups were scientists and farmers. The proposed model substantially reduced the global and intergroup conflicts associated to the same objectives, modelling the weights assigned to each objective in each dimension to find the most consensual/least conflictive solutions. This model can be a useful tool to improve complex decision-making processes in conservation areas with strong conflicts between stakeholders, such as transboundary biosphere reserves.},

The different types of preferential information and how they are incorporated by the algorithm are discussed. The output of the algorithm is a set of distinct solutions that characterise the portion of weight space searched. The possible different output requirements of decision makers are detailed in the context of the algorithm.

When a particular functional form of the Lorenz curve is specified, it is typically estimated by linear or nonlinear least squares estimation techniques that have good properties when the error terms are independently and normally distributed. Observations on cumulative proportions are clearly neither independent nor normally distributed. This article proposes and applies a new methodology that recognizes the cumulative proportional nature of the Lorenz curve data by assuming that the income proportions are distributed as a Dirichlet distribution. Five Lorenz curve specifications are used to demonstrate the technique. Maximum likelihood estimates under the Dirichlet distribution assumption provide better fitting Lorenz curves than nonlinear least squares and another estimation technique that has appeared in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Bayesian nonparametric methods, particularly the Dirichlet process (DP), have gained increasing popularity in both theoretical and applied research, driven by advances in computing power. Traditional Bayesian estimation, which often relies on Gaussian priors, struggles to dynamically integrate evolving prior beliefs into the posterior distribution for decision-making in finance. This study addresses that limitation by modeling daily security price fluctuations using a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model. Our results demonstrate the DPM’s effectiveness in identifying the optimal number of clusters within time series data, leading to more accurate density estimation. Unlike kernel methods, the DPM continuously updates the prior density based on observed data, enabling it to better capture the dynamic nature of security prices. This adaptive feature positions the DPM as a superior estimation technique for time series data with complex, multimodal distributions.},

abstract = {Flood risk assessment is an important task for disaster management activities in flood-prone areas. Therefore, it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps. In this study, we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences (human health and financial impact) for developing a final flood risk assessment map using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, namely ABMDT (AdaBoost-DT) and BDT (Bagging-DT) were developed with Decision Table (DT) as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map. We used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007, 2009 and 2013 in Quang Nam province of Vietnam; and 14 flood influencing factors of topography, geology, hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid AI models. Various statistical measures were used to validate the models, including the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve called AUC. Results show that all the proposed models performed well, but the performance of the BDT model (AUC=0.96) is the best in comparison to other models ABMDT (AUC=0.953) and single DT (AUC=0.929). Therefore, the flood susceptibility map produced by the BDT model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area. The final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area, and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood-prone areas.}

abstract = {There have been significant advances in the theory of goal programming GP in recent years, particularly in the area of intelligent modelling and solution analysis. The intention of this paper is to provide an overview of these developments, to detail and assess the current state-of-the-art in the subject, and to highlight areas which seem promising for future research. Modelling techniques such as detection and restoration of pareto efficiency, normalisation, redundancy checking, and non-standard utility function modelling are overviewed. The connection between GP and other multi-objective-programming techniques as well as a utility interpretation of GP are examined. The rationality of ranking Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques, and of placing GP in such a ranking, is discussed.}

abstract = {The performance of humans across a range of different kinds of cognitive tasks has been encapsulated as a common statistical factor called g or general intelligence factor. What intelligence actually is, is unclear and hotly debated, yet there is a reproducible association of g with performance outcomes, such as income and academic achievement. Woolley et al. (p. 686, published online 30 September) report a psychometric methodology for quantifying a factor termed “collective intelligence” (c), which reflects how well groups perform on a similarly diverse set of group problem-solving tasks. The primary contributors to c appear to be the g factors of the group members, along with a propensity toward social sensitivity—in essence, how well individuals work with others. A metric for group performance on a battery of cognitive tasks yields a group intelligence quantity: collective intelligence. Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single statistical factor—often called “general intelligence”—emerges from the correlations among people’s performance on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether a similar kind of “collective intelligence” exists for groups of people. In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s performance on a wide variety of tasks. This “c factor” is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.}}

abstract = {The power output of run-of-river small hydropower (SHP) developments is very site sensitive and poses several complex challenges, such as inaccessible terrain and numerous possible hydropower scheme alternatives. We developed a geographic information system-based decision support tool that systematically evaluates all possible hydropower scheme alternatives to assist decision makers in assessing the hydropower potential of large data-scarce regions more objectively. A water and energy budget – based distributed hydrological model and a preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations are integrated and employed in the developed tool. This approach enables the inclusion of both topographical and hydrological factors in the site selection process, allowing the use of hydropower potential as a maximizing criterion during site selection. This paper explores the consideration of topographical factors with and without hydrological factors as approaches for optimized site selection. An application of the tool in the case of Kunhar River Basin in Pakistan demonstrates its robustness. For equivalent criteria weights, site selection considering both factors identified a significantly lower number of sites with a shorter waterway length compared to when only topographic factors were considered. However, both approaches identified essentially the same hydropower potential. Notably, the integration with a distributed hydrological model and the incorporation of hydropower potential as a maximizing criterion for site selection revealed more economically attractive SHP sites. This approach enables a flexible and rigorous evaluation of the hydropower potential of large poorly gauged basins, which is particularly useful for developing countries.}
